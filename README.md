# PracticeExport

This plugin will export your score as PDF, Midi, MusicXML and MP3. Individual
staff export to MP3 is done as well, while lowering the volume of other staffs
for easy rehearsal.

Additionally the plugin can add a metronome to the MP3 exports.

## Compatibility

The plugin currently only works with MuseScore 3.6 due to
[missing API functionality](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore/issues/13593)
in MuseScore 4.
